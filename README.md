Best-Spot
=========

Simple camera vision to detect differences in concurrent images.

Using simpleCV, we're trying to detect when certain areas do not have cars in them..

Plan:

Get dev environment working
  Will
  Paul
  
Injest an image from a Logitech webcam (PID unknown)
See if the image has any pixels significantly different from the previous images
  if yes(
    send an email to us with the location
    so it's more complex, if spot A, tell us it's across the street spot b is right in front of us
